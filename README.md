# flask_web_application

Source code for my personal web application (website) building using Python 3, HTML5, and CSS3.


This was my first dive into any sort of web development and I used it to familiarize myself with the basics of HTML5 and CSS3. I decided to use Flask to deploy this website instead of using just HTML5 and CSS3 because I had some prior experience using Python and wanted to incoorporate that into the project.


The website is no longer being hosted anywhere but the HTML can be found [here](https://github.com/davidherszenhaut/flask_web_application/tree/master/templates).
